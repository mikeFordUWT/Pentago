*   PENTAGO INSTRUCTIONS   *
****************************

To start a game open terminal and cd into PentagoGame/src and type:
java PentagoGame
This should launch a console based version of Pentago.

The first question is if the player would like to play with 1 or 2 players.
Type 1 for a single player game against the AI or 2 to play with another human.

From there the user/first player will be prompted for what color they would like
their piece to be, which will default the other player's piece to the other color.

After this if there is another human player they will be prompted for their name.
If the second player is an AI, the user will be prompted for which algorithm they
would like the AI to use.[A for alpha-beta or M for minimax]

I have the depth of the tree for both algorithms set to 3, since the minimax can
take a bit. If you would like to change it, there is a constant in PentagoGame.java
called TREE_DEPTH on line 25.
Just change that value and recompile with:
javac PentagoGame.java

The next prompt will be which player the user would like to have the first turn.
For the first player, enter 1 and for the second(AI or Human) enter 2.

Beyond this, the user(s) will be prompted for their moves, while the AI will make
there moves based on the algorithm chosen.

If the user's input is ever invalid they will be prompted to re-enter.

I have the moves and rotation print out as board states, for better visualization.
I found this to be more pleasing for looking back at the game than the
1/4 2l format.

Beyond that the game outputs the name of the player who won or a tie, upon
completion.

All relevant output is placed in the file 'output.txt', which will be overwritten
with each new game. The output file will be on the same level as the src folder.
